## Math OCR 

In this project we aim to develop an efficient optical character recognition function that accurately identifies printed mathematical expressions by means of a neural network.The final goal would be understand any printed math expression and give its result as the output. We will first generate a comprehensive training dataset using WL built-in function Rasterize[ ].Then we have to set-up an optimal network that will be trained on the test dataset. A network has recently been proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04938v1.pdf and we will try to implement it on Wolfram Mathematica .
